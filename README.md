# Pure TS

The Pure TS project is a project that allows you to write your whole page in only `typescript`. <br>
Its kinda an experiment, feel free to make your own additions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/koneko/PureTS.git`.
2. Check out the functions in `public/ts/utils.ts`.
3. Write your own code in `index.ts` and `test.ts`, or make new files and add them to the pagesList in `utils.ts`.
4. Use `npm run devBuild` and `npm run dev` in 2 seperate command lines for the proper dev experience. (change out the `tsconfig.json` to your liking)
5. Publish your code in anyway you see fit.
